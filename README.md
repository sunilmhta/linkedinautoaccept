## Features

- Automatically accepts pending connection requests on LinkedIn.
- Configurable delay between each connection request acceptance.
- Easy-to-use interface with a single-click action.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the extension directory.
5. The extension icon should now appear in the Chrome toolbar.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your LinkedIn network page where connection requests are pending.
2. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
3. The extension will automatically accept all pending connection requests.
4. Optionally, configure the delay between each connection request acceptance in the extension options.

## Configuration

- **Delay**: Adjust the delay (in milliseconds) between each connection request acceptance to avoid triggering rate limiting or anti-bot measures on LinkedIn.

## Known Issues

- The extension may not work if LinkedIn's Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents external scripts from modifying the page content.
- LinkedIn may have rate limiting or anti-bot measures that affect the extension's performance.
